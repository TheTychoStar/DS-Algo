### Text styles
Below is a list of usable styles:
- **This is a bold text**

### Quote text

1. You can quote text starting with ">".
> **here is the quoted content**

2. Make a unformatted text in line by using backtick
Learn to use `git commands` is very important

```
git status
git add
git commit
git branch
```
